% organizational management theory, focusing on Agile programs. It was
% thrilling to work on such fast-paced, varied engagements resulting in
% significant change.
% 
% Key experience includes:
% 
% - Provided support for internal finance transformation program around IFRS 17
%   requirements for the insurance industry. I managed the development of
%   training sessions for senior members of our center of excellence globally,
%   collaborated with SMEs to refine and organize existing project materials
%   and proposals, carried out industry and competitive analysis, and created a
%   survey that was sent to leading insurance clientele. This survey was
%   included in Deloitte’s yearly summary, and was used by senior leadership
%   within Deloitte to improve existing client relations and support bids for
%   new client work. 
% 
% - Experience with proposals and RFP/RFI life cycle. This includes: providing
%   research support in writing tailored responses, communicating with SMEs to
